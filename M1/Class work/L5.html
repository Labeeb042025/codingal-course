                <h2>Facts of cat</h2>
                <p>A cat, scientifically known as Felis catus, is a small, carnivorous mammal that has been domesticated by humans for
                thousands of years, primarily for companionship and rodent control. It belongs to the family Felidae, which also
                includes larger wild cats like lions, tigers, and leopards. With its lithe, flexible body, keen senses, and retractable
                claws, the cat is an expert hunter, capable of catching small prey with remarkable precision. Cats are highly
                independent animals, though many form deep, affectionate bonds with their human caretakers. They are known for their
                agility, their quiet, padded steps, and their expressive behaviors, which include purring, meowing, kneading, and using
                their tails and ears to communicate moods. A cat’s eyes are well-adapted for night vision, making them effective hunters
                at dawn and dusk, while their whiskers help them sense their surroundings with great accuracy.
                
                Domesticated cats descended from the African wildcat, and their relationship with humans began around 9,000 years ago,
                likely when humans first began storing grain that attracted mice. Unlike dogs, which were actively bred for specific
                tasks, cats largely domesticated themselves by living near humans and benefiting from a food source. Over time, they
                became fixtures in homes, temples, and even ships, where they were prized for their ability to catch rats and mice. In
                Ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped and even mummified; in medieval Europe, they were sometimes misunderstood and linked
                to superstition, though they never lost their role as stealthy rodent hunters.
                
                Modern domestic cats come in a wide range of breeds, sizes, coat types, and colors, from the hairless Sphynx to the
                long-haired Persian or the large and fluffy Maine Coon. They can be calm or energetic, vocal or quiet, depending on
                breed and personality. Most domestic cats live between 12 and 18 years, although some can live into their 20s. Their
                diet must include animal-based proteins, as they are obligate carnivores and cannot survive on plant-based food alone.
                Cats also exhibit unique behaviors such as grooming themselves constantly, sleeping for long periods—often up to 16
                hours a day—and using scent glands on their face and body to mark territory.</p>

                    pets, cats are beloved for their companionship, mysterious nature, and calming presence. With an estimated global population in the hundreds of millions, cats continue to be among the most popular animals in the world. Whether curled in a sunny window, chasing a toy, or softly purring on a lap, the domestic cat remains a fascinating blend of wild instincts and cozy domesticity.
